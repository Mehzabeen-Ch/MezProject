        <h3>Article heading</h3>
        <h4>Percentages</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> start off with 960px total set width. Partition this container into two parts. If the left side is 70% this is 960x0.7=672px. We also have to next think about the padding.</li>
        <li> Thinking responsively now, we will have the set width not working responsively.So we will change the set width to a percentage.The container will adjust itself now to the screen size automatically. Set the border on and you will be able to visualise this.</li>
    </ul>
   
<p>If you have an image inside this container then we will have to fix this.</p>
