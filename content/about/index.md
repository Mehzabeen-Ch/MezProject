# About Me

<h1>Hi, I'm Mehzabeen Chikhalia</h1>

    <hr>
        <p>I hope to show some of the work I have been doing on the web design course. Please click below on portfolio Page 1 to take you to the tasks page with my codepen links. <br><br>

        Portfolio Page 1 and Portfolio Page 2 focuses on using headings and tag names to provide semantic meaning to the page layout. This is to allow screen readers to navigate through the entire page with ease. 
        <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Download the <a href = "PortfolioPage2.png" download> Portfolio Page 2 Contents</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        Feel free to browse the other pages of which some are still under construction as I learn some more. 
        <br><br>

        I hope to continue to explore some more by using the following web pages.
